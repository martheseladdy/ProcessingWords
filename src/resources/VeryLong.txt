Oh my. Oh my, oh my. What is this? Do
I see a little silhouette of a spy?
POP
Bummer.
KHASHOGGI
Tell me old man, why do you concern
yourself so much with what is past?
POP
Because it is only the past that gives
us hope.
KHASHOGGI
But you have read the secret
histories. Surely you have learned
that there is no hope?
POP
There is always hope.
Pop's hand is caught in the laser cell.
POP (cont'd)
Hope is our birthright.
KHASHOGGI is losing patience, his calm explodes into
momentary rage.
KHASHOGGI
Then where is it! Where is this hope?
Pop pauses before calmly replying.
POP
Anyway the wind blows.
KHASHOGGI
What do you know of the term 'Living
rock'?
POP
Only that which the legend promises.
That salvation is to be found there!
At the place of champions! And that a
bright, bright star will show the way!
Baby!
KHASHOGGI smiles.
KHASHOGGI
Don't you just hate hippies!
Consign this miserable creature to The
Seven Seas of Rhye.
The police close in on Pop, his laser cell flashes, they
place a horrifying electronic helmet on his head. Pop grips
the helmet and SCREAMS....
POP
Make love not waaaaaaaaaaaaaar!
But he is gone. Blackout.
SCENE TWO. VIRTUAL HIGH SCHOOL.
The opening drum beat of RADIO GA GA kicks in.
Now light explodes on stage to reveal massed ranks of clone
like kids, they have fixed smiles, and move with
choreographed symmetrical movements. They are dressed not
quite identically but in very similar clothes to each
other. Happy, kooky, sexlessly sexy, youth orientated
clothes, the Top Shop/Top Girl wardrobe of their era. There
is something sinister about their smiles and clothes,
Stepford Kids.
They sing RADIO GA GA
GA GA KIDS
Global soft
We sit alone and watch your light
Our only friend through teenage nights
And everything we want to get
We down-load from the internet
No need to think, no need to feel
When only Cyber space is real
It makes us laugh. It makes us cry
It makes us feel like we can fly
We can fly!
A blueprint for our life on-line
Touch any key The world is mine
We're lost in space but we don't care
Without your light our world's not there
Complete control you are the power
Our lives are programmed by the hour Global show, Global
show
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Video goo goo
Internet ca ca
All we hear is Cyber space ga ga

Across our screens for hours and hours
We hardly need our eyes or ears
We just log on and our dreams appear
Global show
We're not alone, we have our friends
On Cyber love we can depend

We need our Graphics need our visual

Global show All we hear is Radio ga ga
Video goo goo
Internet ca ca
All we hear is Cyber space ga ga
Marketing blah blah
Always something new?
Global soft All your world loves you!
As the song ends the kids explode into happy clappy
celebration.
GALILEO enters.
GALILEO is different from the young people we have just
seen, he is a sullen, disaffected teen, he doesn't dress in
the happy kooky clothes the others wear, he is the James
Dean of his time, a rebel without a cause, sensitive and
confused. A coiled spring waiting to go boing!
TEACHER
Hey kids, school's out! It's summer
time. Get out there and have some
fun!
GA GA KIDS
That is so cool! Alright!
GALILEO
Hey You!
GA GA KIDS
Yeah What!
GALILEO
You're all Clones! Ga Ga sheep!
GA GA KIDS
Talk to the hand!(Click fingers)
GALILEO
Fools...Morons...Don't You understand
you're all slaves?
The teacher is a bit hip, one of those slightly groovy
teachers who are always trying to get with the kids.
TEACHER
Hey mate, come on, go celebrate! Your
life is just beginning.
GALLILEO
Good! The s-sooner it begins the
sooner it's over with.
Galileo has a slight stutter. We sense it is more that he
can't find the words he wants to say rather than a genuine
disability.
TEACHER
But you have so much potential. You
could get a job with any division of
Globalsoft you choose. How about music
programming?
GALLILEO
I don't want to programme music. I
want to make music. Real music. My own
music.
TEACHER
(Suddenly scared)
Hey! Mate, cool it.
She checks that they are not being overheard.
TEACHER (cont'd)
Now listen www-slash-gordon-at-the
jones's-dot-com.
GALILEO
My name is Galileo Figaro.
TEACHER
Nobody is called Galileo Figaro. Where
on Planet Mall did you come up with
that?
Now Galileo's moment of strutting arrogance is over, he is
scared again, scared and confused.
GALILEO
I've found it. In a dream. I have
dreams you see. And I hear noises,
screeching, thudding, b-banging
noises. And words, words drop into my
head, too many words. Help! I need
somebody. Help! Not just anybody.
TEACHER
I understand. I feel your pain. But
come on mate! You live in a perfect
world. What more could you possibly
want?
Galileo sings I WANT TO BREAK FREE.
GALILEO
I want break free. I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies your so self satisfied
I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows. God knows I want to break free
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
In love with a world that's for real!
I've fallen love
God knows. God knows I've fallen in love
It's strange but it's true - hey!
I know I'm different there's so much I have to do
But I have to be sure. When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free baby
Oh how I have to be free
Oh how I want to break free!
During the instrumental break while Galileo writhes in
tormented anguish.
Galileo sings on.
This existence is wrong
I can't get used to living without, living without,
living without Hope
It's all a lie
I don't want to live alone
But God knows. Got to make it on my own
So people can't you see
God knows I've got to
God knows I need to
God knows I want to break free
A ray of light descends on Galileo. It is a police laser
cell, he is immobilized, frozen, surrounded by bars of
light. Khashoggi and the teacher enter.
KHASHOGGI.
You say this boy wants to make his own
music?
The teacher emerges. Her manner totally changed. We now
realise that the teacher is a police spy.
TEACHER
Yes, the little freak says he hears it
in his dreams.
KHASHOGGI
He is aware that music, other than
that programmed by the Globalsoft
Corporation, is illegal? The act of an
individual.
TEACHER
Of course, but he doesn't care.
Has he ever tried to make an
instrument?
TEACHER
Once in technical studies, he was
caught trying to stretch plastic
string across an empty lunch box.
KHASHOGGI
Did he pluck it?
TEACHER
Yes, but he claimed he did not know
why.
KHASHOGGI
So... An ignorant plucker. I think
that I shall have to talk to this boy.
Khashoggi clicks his fingers and Galileo disappears.
TEACHER
Goodbye "mate" ha ha.
KHASHOGGI
Are there any other potential
bohemians in this years graduation
groups?
TEACHER
I am sorry to have to report commander
that there is one other. A repulsive
creature. A girl.
As the teacher speaks, there appears downstage a young
girl, she is SCARAMOUCHE (she is not called this yet but we
will refer to her as such to avoid complication).
Scaramouche is a teenage girl who doesn't fit, like Galileo
she dresses differently to the teeny pop clones around her,
she is a punk and a loner, all in black she has swathed her
body in huge clothes, the classic disaffected goth
teenager.
SCARAMOUCHE
I want break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies your so self satisfied
I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows
God knows I want to break free
Khashoggi and his officer disappear into darkness as a
nasty group of teen queen cheer leaders enter and start to
taunt Scaramouche.
TEEN QUEEN ONE.
(Whistle) Check out the weirdo, girls.
TEEN QUEEN TWO
Doesn't your mum down load you
anything decent to wear?
SCARAMOUCHE
(defiant)
I make my own fashion statements.
TEEN QUEEN THREE.
What's today's statement then? "Hallo
I'm a pathetic, ugly little zero"?
TEEN QUEEN FOUR.
How will you ever get with one of the
boys from the Boy Zone dressed up like
some sort of freak?
TEEN QUEEN FIVE.
You're a disgrace to the Ga Ga Girls.
SCARAMOUCHE
I ain't no Ga Ga Girl and I'm not
interested in the kind of Boys R Us
derr brain zone clones you hang out
with.
TEEN QUEEN ONE.
You are such a sad loner.
SCARAMOUCHE
(To herself)
Well you sure are right about that,
bitch.
Scaramouche and the Teen Bitches sing SOMEBODY TO LOVE. The
choral bits being delivered as brittle, girly sneers "Take
a look at yourself in the mirror" etc
SCARAMOUCHE (cont'd)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
SCARAMOUCHE + (GIRLS)
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry)
Lord what you doin' to me
(Yeah yeah)
I've spent all my years in believing in you
(Ooh believing you)
But I just can't get no relief
(Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Lord, somebody, ooh somebody, somebody
(Lord somebody,somebody)
Can anybody find me
(Anybody find me)
Somebody to love
TEEN QUEEN FIVE
Somebody to love you? Yeah right.
TEEN QUEEN ONE
Hallo-o that is so not going to
happen.
TEEN QUEEN THREE.
Get a virtual life!
I work hard (She works hard?) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end I go home all on my own
(At the end of the day goes home goes home on her own)
I go down on my knees and start to pray
(down knees Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Lord)
Lord, somebody, ooh somebody,
(somebody)
Can anybody find me,
(please anybody find me)
Somebody to love
(She works hard)
Every Day I try I try I try
(Everyday try I try I try)
But everybody wants to put me down
(Ooh)
They say I'm going crazy
(Ooh)
They say I've got a lot of water in my brain
Ah I've got no common sense
I've got nobody left to believe
(she's got nobody left to believe yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm. I just keep losing my beat
(You'll just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright. No I ain't gonna face no defeat
(she's alright she's alright yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
(ooh this prison cell)
Someday I'm gonna be free Lord!
(Someday I'm gonna be free Lord!)
(Find me somebody to love,Find me somebody to love)
Oh, find me find me find
(Find me somebody to love,Find me(me)somebody to love love)
Ooh
(Find me(me) somebody to love love-Somebody Somebody
Somebody Somebody Somebody Find me Somebody find me
somebody to love)
Can anybody find me
(Anybody find me)
Somebody to love?
(Ooh ooh To love)
At the climax of the song Khashoggi emerges from the
darkness, smooth and sinister.
KHASHOGGI.
How very touching young lady. But
surely you understand that the company
loves you? Arrest her.
SCARAMOUCHE
Globalsoft equals fascism.
Officers enter and grab Scaramouche as the music of KILLER
QUEEN kicks in....
SCENE THREE. THE BOARDROOM.
We find ourselves in the head office of GLOBALSOFT, the
vast multinational that makes and sells everything. Aoffice in the sky looking down on a gleaming city-scape
beneath. DRAPES, the head of Globalsoft Europe is
addressing his impeccably cool, power suited, yuppie staff.
It is Calvin Klein meets Metropolis.
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Workers of Globalsoft! Junior
executives, Senior executives, vice
presidents, presidents, Chairmen,
Chairwomen, Chair-transexuals and
chair-androgenous artificially created
life forms. Please prepare to welcome
the Chief Executive Officer of
Globalsoft Planet Wide! WWW-dot-Killer
Queen-at-Globalsoft-Dot-Com-Slash-the
World!
Huge excitement as Drapes and the assembled super yuppies
sing KILLER QUEEN.
SUPER YUPPIES + (OFFSTAGE)
She keeps Moet and Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
Let then eat cake, she says
Find me on the Internet
A built in a remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
(ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline
GIRLS + OFFSTAGE
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice!
She's a Killer Queen
Gun powder, gelatine
Dynamite with a Laser beam
'N'Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Ba ba ba ba anytime)
Ooh recommended at the price
(Recommended at the price)
Insatiable in appetite
(Insatiable in appetite Wanna try?)
Over the instrumental break the super yuppies dance in a
robotic like manner, at the climax of the instrumental, The
KILLER QUEEN emerges, she is the boss, the SEXY super power
bitch yuppie to end all sexy super power bitch yuppies.
There is massive electronic cheering as she picks up the
song.
KILLER QUEEN
To avoid complications
I never kept the same address
In conversation
I e-mail like a Baroness
Met a man from China
(ooh)
Went down to Geisha Minor
(A killer)
But then again incidentally
(A killer)
If you're that way inclined
(She's a Killer Queen)
Perfume came virtually from Paris
(Virtually)
For cars I couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
Killer Queen preens herself as they adore her.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
I'm a Killer Queen
(She's a)
Gun powder, gelatine
Dynamite with a Laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(ba ba ba ba any time)
Drop of a hat I'm as willing as
Playful as a pussycat
(ooh)
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
(ooh)
To absolutely drive you wild
(Da da Drive you wild wild)
I'm all out to get you
Khashoggi appears on the video screen.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
Commander Khashoggi!
KHASHOGGI
You screamed for me ma 'am
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
The Globalsoft board and I have been
discussing your recent security memo.
We want answers. What of the old
librarian you have been torturing? Do
you take the texts which he discovered
seriously?
KHASHOGGI
Yes Ma'am, I'm afraid that I do.
The yuppies all gasp
KHASHOGGI (cont'd)
The legend clearly states that musical
instruments still exist somewhere on
Planet Mall. At the place of
champions, hidden within the living
rock.
YUPPIE CHORUS
Oh No!
KHASHOGGI
Oh Yes!
KILLER QUEEN
Rock!...But which rock and where? The
whole damn planet's a rock if you
didn't know.
YUPPIE CHORUS
Ha Ha Ha!
KILLER QUEEN
And what of this 'shining star' that
is supposed to guide us? I have had
the company's finest astronomers
combing the heavens for months. There
is no new star.
KHASHOGGI
certainly.
KILLER QUEEN
Well star or no star. I intend to
blast every rock on Planet Mall to
smithereens just in case. Stonehenge!
Mount Rushmore! The famed Victoria
Beckham belly button diamond!If these
grim tools of freedom do exist, I
shall find them.
Yuppies clap three times.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
Two more.
Yuppies clap twice.
KHASHOGGI
As always Ma'am you leave me limp with
excitement.
KILLER QUEEN
Watch it or I'll leave you stiff with
rigor mortis!
Khashoggi disappears from the screen.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
And now let us return to the real
business of Globalsoft. The business
of the complete appropriation of the
imagination of every kid on Planet
Mall. Take a memo! Email to all
consumers planet wide "Dear everybody
in the world. Get on line you pleasure
seekers! And download the Killer Queen
Killer Queen and the company sing PLAY THE GAME.
It is a highly sexy, seductive, sinister song and dance in
which these super yuppies glory in their power.
Whilst they sing, their world is filled with computer
imagery.
Massive screens show glorious Kung Fu kicking Super Girls,
Racing cars crashing, Monsters stalking the Earth, all the
second hand fantasies of computer graphic artists... During
the chorus's of the song these cyber images cease their
endless circular fighting, turn, face outwards and join in.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
Open your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
(It's so easy)
It's so easy all you have do
(It's so easy)
Is fall in love
Play the game
(Play the game)
Everybody play the game of love yeah
(Everybody play the game)
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Take a cyber shopping trip and let yourself go
(Let yourself go)
Give me your life
(Give me your life)
don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do
(It's a free world)
Is fall in love
Play the game Yeah!
(Play the game)
Everybody play the game
(Everybody play the game)
Of love ooh yeah
(Of love)
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to your toes
(Love runs from my head down to your toes)
My love is pumping through your veins
(Play the game)
Driving you insane Oh
(Come come come come)
KILLER QUEEN AND THE YUPPIES
Play the game
Play the game
Play the game
Play the game
(Instrumental)
Give me your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world, all you have to do
Is fall in love yeah
(Play the game), everybody play my game
KILLER QUEEN
Of love, of love
Love, of love, of love
At the end of this corporate love fest the super yuppies
all applaud.
At this moment of camp, semi fascistic triumph for Killer
Queen the Globalsoft board meeting is plunged into
darkness.....
SCENE FOUR. THE LASER CELL.
Now we hear the voice of the Khashoggi, sinister and scary
through the darkness.
KHASHOGGI
We found your laptop boy. We have read
the notes you keep.
Now we see Galileo alone on stage, still trapped in the
cell made of laser beam bars. He snarls back into the
darkness.
Khashoggi emerges from the darkness, GALILEO can not see
him, but can hear him.
GALILEO
So pigs can read. You'll be flying
next.
KHASHOGGI
What does "A wop bop a loo bop a lop
bamm boom" mean?
GALILEO
Isn't it obvious? It means "A wop bop
a loo bop a lop b-bamm boom".
KHASHOGGI
Do you really have a girl named Daisy
who almost drives you crazy?
Now Galileo can see Khashoggi, he taunts the policeman.
GALILEO
Of course! And she knows how to love
me, yes indeed, boy you don't know
what's she's doing to me.
Khashoggi circles Galileo's cage.
KHASHOGGI
Then where is she? What is her E Mail
address? How does she love you? How
does she drive you crazy? Is she a
drug pusher?
Galileo laughs; it is almost as if he wants a
confrontation.
GALILEO
You're madder than I am Pig! There is
no girl named Daisy. I wish there was!
I just wrote it, that's all, it
appeared in my head!
KHASHOGGI
Don't play games with me boy! I'll
make you wish you'd never been born at
all.
Suddenly Galileo's brittle humour leaves him and he shouts
in anguish.
GALILEO
Don't you think I wish that every day!
A cop emerges to question Galileo.
FIRST COP
Where is Penny Lane?
A second cop appears.
SECOND COP
What are the Strawberry Fields?
KHASHOGGI
"Underground, overground Wombling
free....." Tell me boy, who are Tinky
Winky, Dipsy La-La and Po? And why do
they say 'Eh Oh'?
GALILEO
I wish I knew! Oh sweet mother I wish
I knew...
Galileo's confusion and anguish are
painful to see; he almost weeps.
The cops exchange significant glances.
KHASHOGGI
Galileo, do you know, what.... a
Bohemian is?
GALILEO
Haven't you got it yet? I don't know
what anything is.
KHASHOGGI
Excellent. I think we've found you
just in time.
enter.
DOCTOR ONE
The Seven Seas of Rhye, Commander?
KHASHOGGI
Oh no, dear me not yet. Soon, yes. But
first, first I think this boy will
have his uses.
Galileo is taken away as a burst of electronic interference
fills the air. Khashoggi speaks into his Palm Pilot
KHASHOGGI (cont'd)
Khashoggi to Killer Queen.....
SCENE FIVE. POLICE HQ
The Killer Queen addresses Khashoggi from screens.
KHASHOGGI.
Good news Ma'am.
KILLER QUEEN
It had better be, I'm having my daily
bikini wax...Pull!
SFX of wax being pulled off
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
Ahhhhhhh!......So?
KHASHOGGI
I believe that the last remaining
rebels will soon be within my
clutches.
KILLER QUEEN
Then you must crush them without
mercy.
KHASHOGGI.
My my Ma'am. You are an eager beaver.
KILLER QUEEN
You leave my eager beaver out of this.
We were discussing destroying the
rebels.
KHASHOGGI.
I advise discretion Ma'am the last
thing we want to do is worry the Ga Ga
kids. Particularly now, with Summer
upon us once more.
KILLER QUEEN
There are no seasons in the virtual
world Commander.
KHASHOGGI.
Not on line Ma'am. But sadly the
physical world still exists. It's hot
out there, hot and edgy. The rivers
are drying up, the polar ice-caps are
melting and the resistance is growing.
KILLER QUEEN
The Bohemians.
KHASHOGGI.
Of course.
KILLER QUEEN
(sadly)
Who are these people? What do they
want?
KHASHOGGI
They want it all Ma'am. And they want
it now. They want..... their Rhapsody.
General shock at the use of this term.
KILLER QUEEN
That is a proscribed word Commander,
no such state of being exists.
KHASHOGGI.
Not yet Ma'am.
KILLER QUEEN
Not ever! The Bohemian Rhapsody is a
myth! A myth do you hear me! Have you
not reported that the euphoria they
seek can only be unleashed through
music! Real,live, Rock and Roll Music!
KHASHOGGI
That is what they believe Ma'am.
KILLER QUEEN
Then there will be no Rhapsody, for
there are no instruments left on
Planet Mall and the kids will never,
ever make their own music again! PULL!
We hear the sound of the video being disconnected as the
Killer Queen and Khashoggi disappear.
SCENE SIX. THE HOSPITAL.GALILEO
I don't know.
SCARAMOUCHE
Do you know anything?
GALILEO
Yes, I know that I'm different. Which
is why the clones from the Boy zone
hate me.
SCARAMOUCHE
The Ga Ga girls hate me.
GALILEO
Do you know why they hate you?
SCARAMOUCHE
Yeah, they think I'm a lesbian because
I don't wear pastels.
GALILEO
They hate you because they're scared
of you, because you're different,
you're an individual.
SCARAMOUCHE
What do you think they did to us?
GALILEO
I don't know.
SCARAMOUCHE
Do you think they'll ever give up and
leave us alone?
GALILEO
Don't you see? We're a threat.
The opening bass line of UNDER PRESSURE begins
GALILEO(cont'd)
A virus on their hard drive and they
won't give up until they've pointed
their little arrow at us.
SCARAMOUCHE
And dragged us to trash.
Together they sing UNDER PRESSURE.
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
Pressure. Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man asked for
Under pressure
GALILEO
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
SCARAMOUCHE
Puts people on streets
Boom bah bah bay boom bah bah bay
GALILEO
Do day oh Do day oh
SCARAMOUCHE
That's ok
GALILEO
That's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
SCARAMOUCHE
Watching some good friends screaming "let me out!"
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
"Let me out!"
GALILEO
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day dep Ooh ooh da da da bop bop
SCARAMOUCHE
Okay Mm
GALILEO
Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
SCARAMOUCHE
Mmm
GALILEO
De doh dah doh de de doh dah dah mm dah doh ba la lop
SCARAMOUCHE
Oh
GALILEO
People on streets
De dah de dah day
People on streets
De dah de dah de dah de dah
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming "Let me out!"
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
"Let me out!"
GALILEO
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, higher
SCARAMOUCHE
Pressure on people, people on streets
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
GALILEO
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
SCARAMOUCHE
Why? Why?
GALILEO
Why?
SCARAMOUCHE
Love, love, love, love
GALILEO
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
SCARAMOUCHE
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
GALILEO
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
SCARAMOUCHE
Why can't we give love, give love,give love,give love,
give love,give love,give love,give love,give love?
GALILEO
Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
And love dares you to care for the people
on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
caring about ourselves
This is our last chance
This is our last dance
GALILEO
This is ourselves
SCARAMOUCHE
Under pressure
GALLILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
Under pressure
Pressure
At the end of the song they are about to embrace but then
get self conscious releasing they have nearly got carried
away. They break apart in adolescent confusion.
SCARAMOUCHE
So where do we go?
Galileo is changing. Meeting Scaramouche has put some lead
in his pencil; he is less tense and nervous, more
strutting.
GALILEO
Out into the night! Down on the
streets! We're rebels now, cos Baby we
were born to run.
SCARAMOUCHE
Don't call me baby!
Galileo isn't quite grown up yet, he is immediately his old
confused self.
GALILEO
Sorry, it's just a phrase I heard in
my head.
SCARAMOUCHE
Yeah?
GALILEO
Yeah.
SCARAMOUCHE
Well keep it there.
Galileo and Scaramouche run off.....
We hear the sound of a huge explosion.
SCENE SEVEN. KILLER QUEEN'S CONTROL ROOM.
The Killer Queen and Khashoggi with a Yuppie in attendance
arrive through the trap wearing hard hats.
KHASHOGGI
Well Madam, we have now pulverised
every rock on planet mall and not a
single instrument of mass destruction
has been found. The legend is a myth
or if you prefer the myth is a legend.
KILLER QUEEN
I like it both ways.
KHASHOGGI
So I've heard ma'am.
KILLER QUEEN
We've won Khashoggi. The Bohemians
will never achieve their rhapsody.
KHASHOGGI
With respect Ma'am the Bohemians
remain dangerous, all they need is a
leader. That's all it takes. One young
soul rebel, one crazy kid with a
dream, a guitar and a bad arsed babe
to fight for.
KILLER QUEEN
Could such a hero exist?
KHASHOGGI
Oh but he already does Ma'am, though
he doesn't know it. He does not know
himself at all, but I do. I've always
had a talent for spotting potential.
KILLER QUEEN
And crushing it.
KHASHOGGI
That is my job Ma'am. And with the
last dream extinguished there will be
nothing left on Planet Mall but
entirely untrammelled marketing and
completely uncritical consumers. Put
them together and what do you get?
KILLER QUEEN
Alchemy Khashoggi, pure alchemy.
Khashoggi and the Killer Queen sing IT'S A KIND OF MAGIC.
KILLER QUEEN (CONT'D)

ALL
Now we are ONE
Killer Queen and Khashoggi fade into darkness
SCENE EIGHT. A WASTELAND.
Voices are heard from the sewers.
BRITNEY VOICE
I think it's clear up there Meat
MEAT VOICE
Are you sure the cops have gone?
BRITNEY VOICE
I'm going to the surface.
MEAT VOICE
Be careful! I'm coming up too......
Britney and Meat emerge wearily, watching out for cops.
BRITNEY VOICE
No! You are so stubborn.
MEAT VOICE
Yeahhhhhhh! But that's why you love
me!
BRITNEY
Alright! So what we got?
MEAT
Well not much, it's mainly plastic and
hydrocarbons. But there's a sheet of
tin that we can wobble.
BRITNEY
Yeah.
MEAT
And some pebbles that make a nice
rattle.
BRITNEY
Cool.
MEAT
A bottle to blow across.
BRITNEY
MEAT
And this great wire to twang.
BRITNEY
Sweet sweet music.... If only we could
find another bit of wood to bang
against the one we've got.
MEAT
Yeah. Oh you naughty boy, I think I've
found a nice big piece of wood right
here.
BRITNEY
Don't change the subject! Your job is
to take this stuff back to The
Heartbreak.
MEAT
But Brit....
BRITNEY
I travel alone, you know that. I
can't do the things I have to do if
all I'm thinking about is you.
Meat knows that she must let Brit go.
MEAT
Sometimes I wish you didn't care so
much. Sometimes I wish we'd never even
heard of the vibe.
BRITNEY
You don't mean that.
MEAT
No.... I suppose not but I miss you so
much baby. It's tougher every time you
go away.
BRITNEY
I'll be back. I always come back. And
one day I'll bring the Dreamer with
me.
MEAT
Sometimes I think it's us that's
dreaming, but perhaps the music really
did die.
BRITNEY
It's only sleeping baby. It's in a
deep deep sleep. It won't be me that
BRITNEY
Two hearts with a one track mind
So much to do in one life time
YOUTH
People do you hear me?
MEAT
Not a time for compromise
and where's and why's and living lies
BRITNEY
So I'm livin it all
MEAT
Yes I'm livin it all
BRITNEY
And I'm givin it all
MEAT
and I'm giving it all!
BRITNEY
(Spoken)
Imagine it Meat, the whole world
joining in?
MEAT
(Spoken)
Thousands of people in front of us!
BRITNEY
(Spoken)
Rows and rows of them!
MEAT
(Spoken)
With their hands in the air.
BRITNEY AND YOUTH
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
BRITNEY AND MEAT AND YOUTH
I want it all - I can hear them!
I want it all - The kids are with us!
I want it all and I want it now - They're back!
BRITNEY AND MEAT
Yeah
Yeah
Ooh I want it all
YOUTH
{I want it all }
{I want it all }
{I want it all }
{I want it now } Underscore to 'Yeah Yeah'
{I want it all }
{I want it all }
{I want it all }
YOUTH (cont'd)
I want it
BRITNEY
MEAT
I want it
BRITNEY AND MEAT
I want it NOW!
(NOW!)
I want it ALL!
They hear someone coming.Britney grabs his bag.....Quickly
they hide in the van.... Galileo and Scaramouche enter.....
Their entrance should reflect their growing confidence and
rebel status, perhaps they spin in on wires. They are both
very excited with their new found freedom.
GALILEO
I know I talk about myself alot but
hey there's alot to say...all my life,
all my life I've felt that I have a
sort of purpose, a special destiny.
That has to mean something, surely.
SCARAMOUCHE
It does, that you're an arrogant, self
important arsehole. What special
destiny?
GALILEO
It's to do with the stuff I dream. The
phrases, they always come back to the
same thing, I see a great wide space
and people, people everywhere, and
noise, huge, huge noise! And then
comes the words...
SCARAMOUCHE
What words?
GALILEO
"Seek salvation in the place of living
rock... A bright bright star will show
the way.... go to where the Champions
played"
SCARAMOUCHE
Sounds like bollocks to me.
GALILEO
Maybe. I think I dreamt a name for
you, you know.
SCARAMOUCHE
How would you do that? You only met me
today.
GALILEO
I always knew I'd meet you, that there
was another Rebel Rebel out there,
another Wild Thing.
SCARAMOUCHE
OK, so what do you want to call me?
GALILEO
(Proudly)
Scaramouche.
SCARAMOUCHE
Scaramouche?.... Don't you think...
that's a bit.... Crap.
GALILEO
Well I dreamt some others but frankly
I thought that was the best.
SCARAMOUCHE
What were the others?
GALILEO
Long Tall Sally, Honky Tonk Woman,
Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds or Fat
Bottomed Girl.
SCARAMOUCHE
OK, I'll take
Scaramouche....Scaramouche....
Actually, I kind of like it, it
sounds... anarchic... almost like,
like what I think they used to call a
tune.
This comment strikes a chord with Galileo, he remembers the
words from his dream.
GALILEO
A tune, yes.
Scaramouche... Scaramouche, will you
do the fandango...
SCARAMOUCHE
Are you trying to get into my pants?
GALILE0
No!
SCARAMOUCHE
Then what's doing the fandango?
GALILEO
I think... perhaps it's... dancing.
SCARAMOUCHE
You mean Ga Ga Moves? Ugh, excuse me
while I puke. Globalsoft write the
song and work out the steps then every
kid on Planet Mall does exactly the
same thing.
GALILEO
I think that maybe there was a time
when dancing wasn't like that, when it
was... free. (BO RAP heard again)
Kind of individually expressive.
Again Galileo is almost speaking things he does not know,
we hear the faintest guitar break and GALILEO strikes a
classic Freddie arm in the air pose. Then in his mind he
hears the crazy GUITAR BIT from BO RAP and he freaks out
for a moment, hippy dancing with a bit of Status Quo style
posturing.... Again Scaramouche (who unlike the audience,
has not heard the music) is not impressed.
SCARAMOUCHE
I don't think I've ever seen anything
quite so embarrassing in my life.
GALILEO
It looks better when I'm holding a
tennis racket
SCARAMOUCHE
It would have to.
GALILEO
Well perhaps doing the fandango is
just about being friends.
Galileo is finally getting through Scara's shell.
SCARAMOUCHE
Friends? I...I've never had a friend.
GALILEO
What... and you with your winning
ways!
SCARAMOUCHE
But I always thought I'd like one.
This is a sigificant moment, Scarmouche being nice.
GALILEO
So are we friends then?
SCARAMOUCHE
If you want.
GALILEO
I do! I really do!
SCARAMOUCHE
Well then, OK. We're friends.
GALILEO
This is so cool.
They are drifting into a kiss...But just as Galileo is
about to enfold Scara in his arms, she pulls away.
Meat and Britney appear from the van.
MEAT
Let's get them!
Meat advances on Scaramouche. Scaramouche responds with a
karate move. Meat then pulls a flick knife out on her...
SCARAMOUCHE
Oh.
MEAT
Talk quick bitch where did your boy
friend get the words!
SCARAMOUCHE
What words?
MEAT
He calls you Scaramouche! He's read
the fragments! He knows the Holy Text!
GALILEO
I don't know any Holy Text. I don't
know what you're talking about!
BRITNEY
"Long Tall Sally" "Honky Tonk Woman"
.... The words man, the words from the
past.
MEAT
You've seen the fragments, you've been
to the Heartbreak Hotel! You're a spy.
GALILEO
I said I don't know what you're
talking about. I just hear things in
my mind that's all!
BRITNEY
Who are you!
Galileo is again consumed with anguish.
GALILEO
I don't know! Why do people keep
asking me that! I am the Walrus! I'm
just a Teenage Dirt Bag baby. Do you
hear the drums Fernando? I am the
Dancing Queen.
Meat and Britney exchange glances, this is very strange.
BRITNEY
You... just hear these words? In your
head?
GALILEO
Yes, I don't know where they come
from, it drives me mad, all these
phrases and sounds, stupid, useless
phrases and questions, so many
questions. Why do Fools Fall in Love?
Who was The Real Slim Shady? Do you
Think I'm Sexy? Who let the dogs out?
Who who-who who? It's torture, all I
know, and I don't know why I know it,
is that I really really really want to
Zig a Zig Ah.
Britney and Meat are tense with excitement.
BRITNEY
Meat.... we've found him. This dude is
the one. He's The Man.
MEAT
I say he's a spy.
BRITNEY
No, he's the Dreamer, the one we've
been waiting for, this is him.
MEAT
Test him... and his chick.
SCARAMOUCHE
His"chick"? What am I now, poultry?
GALILEO
I don't have to prove myself to you.
MEAT
Test him!
Britney and Meat check once more to see that they are
alone. Then Britney begins to sing, unaccompanied.
BRITNEY
Mama. Just killed a man.
Put a gun against his head. Pulled the trigger.
Now he's dead.
Britney stops and points to Galileo. There is BIG MAGIC in
the air... the lighting changes.
Britney and Meat stare hard at Galileo. This is a strangely
charged moment.... Now the light shines on Galileo who
begins to sing, he is scared and tentative, also
unaccompanied.
GALILEO
Mama, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away....
Britney and Meat are almost in awe.
BRITNEY
He knows the text, but he never read
it! He's the man.
Meat turns on Galileo.
MEAT
Then what does it mean! Tell us! Who
is Mama? Who's been killed? Why has it
all been thrown away!
GALILEO
I don't know!
MEAT
We've been searching for the meaning
all our lives.
GALILEO
I tell you I don't know! I just...
hear the words, that's all.
Galileo sings again, now his voice is strong and confident.
Still he is unaccompanied.
GALILEO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Mama Ooooh.
Britney and Meat have made their decision. This is
important.
BRITNEY
You have to come with us.
MEAT
Not her. She isn't the one, we don't
need her.
GALILEO
I'm not going without Scaramouche.
SCARAMOUCHE
Gazzer, who says I want to go
anywhere? These people could be
killers.
BRITNEY
We are baby, killers, thrillers and
Bismillah's!
MEAT
We're the resistance. The last hope.
BRITNEY
We are the Bohemians.
MEAT
And now you have a choice! Are you
ready to break free.
BRITNEY
Do you want it all
MEAT
To be a shooting star! A tiger.
BRITNEY
Defying the laws of gravity.
MEAT
Are you ready to be champions?
SCARAMOUCHE
Nah,sounds a bit boring if you ask me.
GALILEO
What?
SCARAMOUCHE
I'm joking Gazzer. Of course I want to
go.
GALILEO
All right!
The music of HEADLONG kicks in.
BRITNEY
Then understand this, if you come with
us, if you join the Bohemians, there's
no way back to Ga Ga land, you'll be
an outcast for ever. No longer a
member of the Cons-human Race!
SCARAMOUCHEMEAT
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
BRITNEY
Now you've got strings you're going to lose your rag
MEAT
You're getting in a fight and it ain't so groovy
BRITNEY
When you're screaming in the night
BRITNEY AND MEAT
Get me out of this cheap B movie
ALL - (ALL + OFFSTAGE)
(Headlong) down the highway
And you're rushing (headlong), out of control
And you think you're (so strong)
BRITNEY
But there ain't no stoppin'
MEAT
And you can't stop rockin'
ALL
And there's nothing you can, nothing you can, nothing you
can do about it
As they descend they are passing through geological layers.
SCARAMOUCHE
Where are we going!
MEAT
We're going down hen!
Now Galileo and Scaramouche are at the centre of the song,
thrilled to be together and joining the resistance.
GALILEO
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
ALL + OFFSTAGE
Hoop diddy diddy
Hoop diddy do
SCARAMOUCHE
Soon the fire starts a burnin'
Makes em more than half crazy
ALL + OFFSTAGE
Hoop diddy diddy
Hoop diddy do
GALILEO
Now you start freakin everywhere you turn
You can't stop running cos your feet got burned
SCARAMOUCHE
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cos reason's out the window better hold on tight
ALL - (ALL + OFFSTAGE)
You're rushin' (headlong)
GALILEO - (GALILEO +
OFFSTAGE)
Down the highway
And you're rushin' (headlong)
SCARAMOUCHE - (SCARA +
OFFSTAGE)
Out of control
You think your (so strong)
ALL
But there ain't no stoppin'
MEAT
And there's nothin'
GALLILEO
Nothin'
SCARAMOUCHE
Nothin'
BRITNEY
Nothin'
ALL - (ALL + OFFSTAGE)
Nothin' you can nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it!
(Headlong)!
SCENE TEN. THE HEARTBREAK HOTEL.
The song is over and we discover Galileo, Scaramouche,
Britney and Meat. They have descended into the underworld.
BRITNEY
Welcome to the Heartbreak Hotel.
The Heartbreak Hotel is deep beneath the city. Huge
drainage and fuel pipes amongst the rocks etc. But also
plastered to the walls and pipes are ancient old torn
posters and bits of magazines. Classic rock memorabilia.The
Bohemians are all like Britney and Meat,weirdly dressed in
a complete mix up of rock and pop fashions.BIG MACCAspeaks.
BM
Who are these two Brit?
BRITNEY
I think I've found him. The one we've
been waiting for. The dreamer.
BOHEMIANS
Gasps
BM
The dreamer? Just because he has
excellent muscle definition does not
make him Peter Andre.
BOHEMIANS
Laughs
BRITNEY
He calls himself.... Galileo.
BOHEMIANS
Wows
There is general shock a this.
BM
Galileo? Then he must have seen the
texts. He's a spy.
MEAT
Which is what I said.
BIG MACCA
Kill him!
The Bohemians all rush towards Galileo ready to attack.
BRITNEY
Anyone who tries to kill the dude has
to come past me.
(Britney halts them with his arm and as his does his hand
inadvertently lands on one of Puffs breasts.)
PUFF
That is my boobie!
BRITNEY
Sorry
MEAT
He says he dreams the words.
BRITNEY
He calls the chick Scaramouche.
Scaramouche is getting pretty pissed off with this casual
sexism.
SCARAMOUCHE
What is this 'chick' business? Do I
have feathers? Do I lay eggs?
BM
Oi lady. The text teaches us that in
the age of rock babes were known as
chicks as a mark of respect second
SCARAMOUCHE
Something tells me you've got that
wrong.
GALILEO
You keep speaking of these texts.
What are these 'texts' anyway?
Big Macca is slowly beginning to trust Galileo.
BM
Fragments, nothing more. Stuff that we
and other Bohemians across the global
shopping precinct have found.
Another Bohemian speaks up, a girl called CHARLOTTE CHURCH
CHARLOTTE CHURCH
We have scraps of stuff, magazines....
BM
Yes. They were kind of like Web Sites
but they were made of paper and you
could touch them. And weird, static
commercials, stuck to walls, they were
called posters. We take our names from
these clues from the age of rock.
ARETHA
I'm Aretha.
JACKSON FIVE
Jackson Five
EDDIE COCHRANE
Eddie Cochrane
JUSTIN TROUSERSNAKE
Justin Trousersnake
BM
And I, I am Paul McCartney. But I
prefer to be known as Sir Paul
McCartney.
BOHEMIANS
Groans
MEAT
And I'm Meat. You can call me Miss
Loaf.
MADONNA
I'm Madonna.
PUFF
They call me P Puff Diddy Daddy Dum
Diddy Do.
A rather weedy youth.
CLIFF RICHARD
Yes hello, I'm Cliff Richard.
CHARLOTTE CHURCH
Charlotte frigging Church.
BOB
And I'm Bob. Bob the poet. Bob the
rebel. Bob the prophet. I am Bob the
Builder.
Galileo turns to Britney, there is a connection.
SCARAMOUCHE
And who are you?
BRITNEY
And I'm the biggest, badest, meanest,
nastiest, ugliest, most raging,
rapping, rock and rolling, sick, punk,
heavy metal, psycho bastard that ever
got get down funky. They call me
Britney Spears.
GALILEO
And what is this place, this
'Heartbreak Hotel'.
BM
Get the man a chair.
SCARAMOUCHE
And where do you get all this great
stuff? You look fantastic.
MEAT
We find it, we're scavengers. Fancy a
makeover? C'mon you're a bohemian now.
The girls begin to chatter excitedly about clothes.
SCARAMOUCHE
We-e-ll
MEAT
How about some tight jeans?
SCARAMOUCHE
I hate my bum.
MEAT
A short skirt?
SCARAMOUCHE
I hate my legs.
MEAT
A cropped top?
SCARAMOUCHE
I hate my stomach... And my hips.... I
quite like my arms...
Well then maybe you could.....
SCARAMOUCHE
But not my hands...
MEAT
So, something that accentuates your
elbows? Go on hen, I've got loads of
stuff back there, just have a laugh.
SCARAMOUCHE
It's you lot that will be having the
laugh!
Scaramouche disappears behind the tube station door. Big
Macca attempts to re-focus the Bohemians. The mood changes.
BIG MACCA
As I was saying. We built this place
as a shrine, a shrine to the long
dead king.
GALLILEO
What king?
The lights dim out of respect and we hear an instrumental
section of NO ONE BUT YOU. The Bohemians recite their holy
story with great sadness.
BM
Little is known about him except that
his name was Pelvis, a poor boy from
nowhere who sang like an angel and
danced like the devil. A teenage truck
driver who broke free to become a
mighty rebel, a rebel who spawned a
thousand rebels.
PUFF
But he was too wild, too free.
BOB
So they put him in the army.
CHARLOTTE CHURCH
And then they made him make hundreds
of movies with girls in bikinis.
MADONNA
Singing songs about hula hoops to
gangs of grinning kids.
CHARLOTTE CHURCH
The king was dead.
BM
And many princes and rebels died
thereafter. The songs have been lost,
but their names live on. We remember
those that died young, Buddy Holly
(ALANA)
Jimi Hendrix..
CHARLOTTE CHURCH
Kurt Cobain
BOB
Janice Joplin
PUFF
Jim Morrison
JUSTIN
Bob Marley
BM
John Lennon
MEAT
Freddie....
Meatloaf and the Bohemians sing NO ONE BUT YOU.
A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in heaven
Do you want us to cry
And everywhere the broken hearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying to close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get to drownin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well what would you do?
Yes! It was such an operation
(Ooh)
Forever paying every due
Hell you made a sensation
(A sensation)
You found a way through
(Found a way though)
One by one. Only the good die young
(One by one. Only the good die young)
They're only flying to close to the sun
(They're flying close to the sun)
We'll remember Forever
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was it the way it was planned?
And so we'll grace another table
(Ooh)
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
and I ain't never never sayin' goodbye
And it's one by one
(One by one)
Only the good die young
(Only the good die young)
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
(They're only flying too close to the sun)
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no one
No one but you.
Scaramouche re-enters rather gingerly through the door.
SCARAMOUCHE
Da Dah!
Bohemians cheer and show general appreciation.
MEAT
You look great hen!
SCARAMOUCHE
No I don't
MEAT
You do, totally rock and roll!
Bohemians cheer again.
GALLILEO
That's right Scaramouche. You do look
totally rock and roll. What is Rock
n' Roll?BRITNEY
Like me and Meat!
BOHEMIANS
Yeah!
BRITNEY
Or you and Scaramouche!
SCARAMOUCHE
What?
BRITNEY
You see Galileo, what passes for music
these days is created only for money,
which is why it has no soul. But when
Rock n' Roll began you know why they
did it?
GALILEO
For their babies!
BOHEMIANS
Yeah!
BRITNEY
Of course, they did it for a crazy
little thing called love.
Together Britney and Meat sing CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED
LOVE the company all join in but it is clearly a love song
between Britney and Meat.
Ah-oom, ah-oom, ah-oom, ah-oom,ah-oom, ooh ooh
BRITNEY
This thing called love. I just can't handle it
MEAT
This thing called love. I must get round to it
BRITNEY
I ain't ready
BRITNEY AND MEAT
Crazy little thing called love
MEAT
This thing called love
(this thing called love)
It cries in the cradle all night
(Like a baby)
BRITNEY
It swings, it jives, it shakes all over like a jelly fish
(ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
MEAT
I kinda like it.
(I kinda like it)
BRITNEY AND MEAT
Crazy little thing called love
BRITNEY
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
(Ooh ooh aah)
She drives me crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool cool sweat!
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip, get on my tracks
(ooh ooh, ooh ooh, man!)
Take a back seat. Hitch hike
(Back seat Hitch hike ooh Vroom Vroom)
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
(Uh huh)
BRITNEY AND MEAT
Crazy little thing called love
(Crazy little thing called love)
GALILEO
I gotta be cool, a-relax
Get hip, and get on my tracks
SCARAMOUCHE
Take a back seat.
(Ahmm)
GALILEO
Hitch hike
SCARAMOUCHE
And take a long ride on my motor bike
(Ahmm-mm)
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Until I'm ready
(Are you ready)
BRITNEY
Crazy little thing called love
BOHEMIANS
This thing
BRITNEY

BOHEMIANS
Called love
MEAT

BOHEMIANS
I just Woah!
MEAT

BOHEMIANS
This thing
This thing
BOHEMIANS

BOHEMIANS

MEAT AND BRITNEY
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
BRITNEY
Crazy little thing called love
MEAT AND BRITNEY
Crazy little thing called love
BRITNEY
Alright
ALL
Oh YEAH!
The song ends in exultant triumph.Sirens wail, lights
flash. There are cops everywhere. The march on from all
sides, descend from the air, appear through the floors. The
bohemians gather together in defence. Khashoggi enters.
KHASHOGGI
Oh yeah indeed!
Police encirlce Bohemians and lead them into centre stage.
Two Policemen keep Galileo and Scaramouche downstage.
KHASHOGGI (cont'd)
Finally I am checking into the
Heartbreak Hotel. And so Mr.
McCartney...I say hello and you say
goodbye! Incarcerate the rebels!
The Laser cell is turned on
BRITNEY
No! You'll never take the Dreamer
while I'm alive.
KHASHOGGI
And you'll never escape the laser
cage!
Britney breaks out of the laser cage
BRITNEY
Galileo! Scaramouche! The future of
rock lies with you!
begins.
For a second Galileo is torn, but he knows that he and
Scaramouche must run. As OGRE BATTLE gets big and Britney
and the other Bohemians hold off the cops Galileo grabs
Scaramouche's hand and they escape...
ACT TWO. SCENE ONE. GA GA LAND.
Act Two opens in darkness we hear the weird slo-mo intro of
ONE VISION. Then as the dirty guitar riff kicks in the
lights blast up on the surface of Planet Mall.
The Ga Ga kids in full automated glory appear. These happy
clappy Stepford boys and girls sing ONE VISION.
GA GA KIDS
Hey! One plan, one goal, one mission
No heart, no soul just one solution
One flash of light, yeah, one God, One vision
One comfort zone
One true religion
One voice, one hope
One real decision
Whoa yeah
Oh yeah Oh yeah
FREDDIE
I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
GA GA KIDS
But a cold wind blows and a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dream
One vision
So give us your hands
Give us your hearts
We're ready
There's only one direction
One world and one nation
On television
No hate, no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration
Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah
One, one, one, one, one, one, one
(8 Bars of instrumental)
Ahh Ahh!
One flesh, one clone
One true religion
One voice, one hope
One real decision
Give us one night yeah
Give us one hope Hey!
Just give us Ah!
One plan, one scam
One star, one night
One day Hey
Hey just gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Fried chicken!
The song ends. The applause is interrupted by police sirens
and search lights. We hear an electronic announcement.
POLICE MEGAPHONE
(Rebel alert, rebel alert.)
The Ga Ga kids exit with urgency.
SCENE TWO. WRECKED CAR.
Galileo and Scaramouche appear through the grills,
exhausted and alone, lost in the underworld.
GALILEO
How did Khashoggi find the Heartbreak
Hotel!
SCARAMOUCHE
He must have some way of tracking
us....
GALILEO
The hospital! When they operated on
our heads!
Galileo takes hold of Scaramouche's head, gently he feels
about her forehead.
GALILEO (cont'd)
I think.... I think I've found
something.
Scaramouche gets a shard of glass from the van.
SCARAMOUCHE
Cut it out.
GALILEO
What!
SCARAMOUCHE
Gazzer, if there are bugs in our heads
then the cops will run us down in
hours. Cut it out!
Reluctantly Galileo takes the shard of glass and as gently
as he can cuts into Scaramouche's hair line. She gasps but
he removes a flashing device.
GALILEO
He had us from the start. He's heard
everything...
SCARAMOUCHE
Hello pervert! Short
sentence....second word is "off"!
GALILEO
OK now me.
She moves towards him and he screams loudly.
SCARAMOUCHE
I haven't done it yet
GALLILEO
I knew that!
She takes the glass and cuts out a flashing bug.
GALILEO
Quick, crush them.
SCARAMOUCHE
What? A couple of state of the art
micro transceivers? No way, I'll just
activate the maximum negativity
spectrum.
GALILEO
What?
SCARAMOUCHE
Turn them off.
GALILEO
We're all that's left now Scaramouche,
you know that don't you? The Bohemians
are finished. The Heartbreak hotel
destroyed. Only we escaped.
SCARAMOUCHE
Britney Spears died to save us. To
save you.
GALILEO
And he must not have died in vain.
It's up to us now. We're part of the
underworld Scaramouche. You and me,
cast adrift. There's no going back,
not now, not ever.
SCARAMOUCHE
We never belonged anyway. Did you
notice, you lost your stutter?
GALILEO
I feel different.
SCARAMOUCHE
We're both different.... For the first
time in my life I don't hate myself.
GALILEO
And I don't want to die.... I've found
something to live for.
SCARAMOUCHE
The dream?
GALILEO
You.
Music starts for WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER. For a moment
they look into each other's eyes.
GALILEO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
But we will be caught in the end, you
know that don't you?
SCARAMOUCHE
Yes. I know and probably killed.
GALILEO
I love you Scaramouche.
SCARAMOUCHE
I love you too Gazz.
GALILEO
Do you think maybe just once you could
use my whole name?
SCARAMOUCHE
I love you too, Gazza Fizza.
She touches him tenderly.
GALILEO
Well if you love me then dying doesn't
matter very much at all, does it?
They sing WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER together as they sing
they dance ever closer, they truly are falling love.
SCARAMOUCHE & GALILEO
There's no time for us, there's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
yet slips away from us
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh
There's no chance for us. It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh
Who dares to love forever?
Oh ooh When love must die
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your finger tips
And we can have forever. And we can love forever
Forever is ours today
And we can live forever
And we can love forever
Forever is ours
Who waits forever anyway
Now they embrace and their embrace fades into love making.
The lights fade...
SCENE THREE. LASER CAGES.
Now we hear the sinister and urgent throb of FLASH
intruding on the darkness. The lights come up to reveal a
terrible sight. The surviving Bohemians. Big Macca,
Madonna, Aretha etc. are being held captive by Khashoggi.
Each is held in a laser cage as Khashoggi walks amongst
them.
KHASHOGGI
What do you know of the phrase "living
rock" where is "the place of the
Champions?"
BM
They are freedom words Pig, words the
Dreamer used. We don't know what they
mean.You wish! No I was thinking more of
The 7-Seas of Rye.
MEAT
Dreamer follow us. Bohemians, give him
your power, make your last thoughts
the dream.
KHASHOGGI
Goodnight Miss Loaf!
ALL
NO!!!!
The music of SEVEN SEAS OF RHYE strikes up and Cops enter
the cages. The cops are carrying BRAIN WASHING HELMETS, the
Bohemians are horrified and try to fight.
The Bohemians struggle desperately as the cops force
helmets onto their heads as KHASHOGGI and the cops sing
SEVEN SEAS OF RHYE.
KHASHOGGI
Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your Earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Can you hear me you peers and privvy councillors
(Ah)
I stand before you naked to the eyes
(Ah)
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
(Ah)
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Sister I live and I lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine and I possess you belong to you forever ahh!
(forever ever ever)
Storm the master marathon and I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire and I'll survive
(I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the lords of nature and come out alive
(I'll survive, I'll survive,I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you shod and shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
It is violent and nasty. As the song progresses the
Bohemians fight less and less and instead they twitch and
writhe like automatons. By the end of the song the
Bohemians have been completely subdued by the helmets, they
hang limply in their laser cages like puppets on lifeless
strings.
Now as the song turns to the last bit, the "Do Like to Be
Beside the Seaside" bit, the cops are gone leaving only the
pathetic Bohemians hanging in their cages limply singing.
EX BOHEMIANS
Oh I do like to be beside the sea side
Oh I do like to be beside the sea.
Then they disappear.
SCENE FOUR. WRECKED CAR.
We are back in the lower depths with Galileo and
Scaramouche, Galileo is asleep. Scara is awake, tinkering
with something.
Galileo awakes with a start.
GALILEO
The Seven Seas of Rhye!
SCARAMOUCHE
(Very chirpy)
Well good morning Gazzer! Or perhaps I
should use your full name Shagileo
Gigolo.
GALILEO
I've had this dream and.....Shagileo
Gigolo?
(pleased)
You really think so?
SCARAMOUCHE
Oh yes.
She leans across to embrace him, he almost succumbs.
GALILEO
No, Scaramouche, we don't have time!
The Seven Seas of Rhye, I've been
dreaming about Sir Paul McCartney and
the others. I dreamt that there were
cops and there were cages made of
lasers and....
SCARAMOUCHE
Gazzer, believe me there is nothing
and I mean nothing more boring than
people wanting to describe their
dreams to you.
GALILEO
No but really....
SCARAMOUCHE
Trust me on this, it kills
relationships stone dead, the day one
partner wakes up and starts saying "it
was amazing, there was this rabbit in
a bowler hat cooking an omelette"
that's when love dies.
GALILEO
Scaramouche I'm sure of it, The
Bohemians are heading across the Seven
Seas of Rhye.
SCARAMOUCHE
I know.
GALILEO
I think it's somewhere in the Euro
precinct of Planet Mall, there's
water, lots of water....What?
SCARAMOUCHE
I know about the Seven Seas of Rhye,
they're not seas at all, but rivers,
rivers that supply a Lake. They used
to call it Lake Geneva. The spirit of
rock's very strong there. It's where
they put the misfits, the rebels.
GALILEO
But this is incredible Scaramouche!
We've had the same dream! It's like
we're soul mates, split aparts,
kindred spirits....
SCARAMOUCHE
Gaz, I didn't have any dream, I've
just reversed the polarity on one of
Khashoggi's micro transcievers. I've
been monitoring police Headquarters.
GALILEO
Wow, you certainly know how to make a
guy feel inadequate.
SCARAMOUCHE
Oh bless! Let me make it up to you.
Once more she leans across.
GALILEO
No Scaramouche, maybe later but right
now I have to go to the Seven Seas.
SCARAMOUCHE
Pretty dangerous, the cops are bound
to be still after us. I say we hide
out here on this mattress for a few
days...and While we're here...
GALILEO
No Scara, I still haven't found what
I'm looking for. I can't get no
satisfaction. You don't stop till you
get enough... Aaaah (Angry and
confused) Ga... Doo doo doo push
pineapple shake the tree.
SCARAMOUCHE
Pardon?
GALILEO
Nothing...Look, I'm going Scaramouche,
but I shall come back and....
SCARAMOUCHE
Hang on, what do you mean? There'll be
cops all over the place. I should go,
not you.
GALILEO
Forget it Scaramouche, this is my
fight!
SCARAMOUCHE
Excuse me? How do you work that out?
GALILEO
Because I'm the man! Britney Spears
said so.
SCARAMOUCHE
Exactly, which is why it's stupid for
you to risk your life. I'm
dispensable. You stay here.
GALILEO
Oh yeah, like I'm really going to let
my chick go fight my battles for me!
SCARAMOUCHE
"Let your chick"! Excuse me, but at
what point in this relationship did
you actually take the arse-hole pill?
GALILEO
Oh for God's sake Scaramouche, does
everything always have to be a fight
with you? I thought you said you'd
mellowed out?
SCARAMOUCHE
Well I haven't!
Well you know it's really starting to
irritate me.
SCARAMOUCHE
Oh no! My heart just broke.
GALILEO
Look! You're my girlfriend and I want
to protect you.
SCARAMOUCHE
You think just because you got your
leg over, you own me or something?
GALILEO
Oh you are such a pain with this
constant female assertion thing!
SCARAMOUCHE
Fine! At least we now know where we
stand.
GALILEO
Yes we do!
SCARAMOUCHE
Which is not together!
GALILEO
If you say so!
SCARAMOUCHE
Right! From now on our relationship is
purely professional; we have a job to
do and we'll do it, that's all.
GALILEO
Suits me. But I'm going to The Seven
Seas.
SCARAMOUCHE
So am I, but if when you get there you
get caught and the dream is lost and
the kids are enslaved till the end of
time, you're going to feel a bit
bloody stupid that's all.
They storm off in different directions, furious.
SCENE FIVE. KILLER QUEEN'S PAD
Killer Queen rises from her trap into her boudoir
surrounded by all her yuppie servants.
(TRACK)
Oh you gonna take me home tonight
Oh down beside that red firelight
Oh you gonna let it all hang-out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rock

KILLER QUEEN

Fat bottomed girl you make the rock-in

Khashoggi rushes on. He seems a little nervy.
KHASHOGGI
Madam. I bring splendid news!
KILLER QUEEN
Later, back in five! So.
Killer Queen clicks her fingers to dismiss the yuppies
Upstage.
KHASHOGGI
My officers have been successful in
breaking up the Bohemian strong-hold!
KILLER QUEEN
Khashoggi this is wonderful! The
resistance is vanquished! We've won!
KHASHOGGI
Uhm yes Ma'am except if I might
contin...
But the Killer Queen is too happy to listen and interrupts
Khashoggi with the opening DON'T STOP ME NOW.
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
KHASHOGGI
Yes Ma'am, if I could just...
KILLER QUEEN
I feel aliy hi- hi- ive!
KHASHOGGI
Ma'am it's just that....
KILLER QUEEN
And the world turning inside out
Floating around in ecstasy

KHASHOGGI
Ma'am
KILLER QUEEN
Don't stop me now...
KHASHOGGI
Ma'am
KILLER QUEEN
Don't stop me
Cos I'm having a good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger.............
KHASHOGGI
MADAM!
KILLER QUEEN
Tell me Commander Khashoggi...
KHASHOGGI
Ma'am?
KILLER QUEEN
What part of 'Don't Stop Me Know'
don't you understand?
KHASHOGGI
It's just that you did not let me
finish.
KILLER QUEEN
Finish now!
KHASHOGGI
We broke up the Heartbreak Hotel but
the Dreamer and his bad arsed babe
escaped. Well gotta go.......
KILLER QUEEN
You lost them!
KHASHOGGI
Lost them, we didn't lose them, we
just don't know where they are.
KILLER QUEEN
I am sick of your excuses Commander!
And I am also sick of you.
KHASHOGGI
Madam?
KILLER QUEEN
With your weary, sneery, posey,
schmozie "look at me I'm wearing
sunglasses indoors" crap.
Khashoggi whips off his shades.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)
Oiling around the place, your snooty
little booty in your Armani suitey.
KHASHOGGI
Actually ma'am its M&S. They've really
rather raised their game lately don't
you think.
KILLER QUEEN
Need I remind you that besides being
business woman of the year I am also
Dynamite with a laser beam.
KHASHOGGI
(gently panicking)
No one admires you more than I do
ma'am. Your gentle manner, your quiet
unassuming sense of style. Your
generous forgiving nature....
KILLER QUEEN
You know what happens to people who
disappoint me. I think it's time to
blow your mind.
Killer Queen sings ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST. It is a very
cool, sinister killing song, all the sweating yuppies cower
before her.
KILLER QUEEN (cont'd)Oi! Oi! Slow down will you!
GALLILEO
No! You keep up!
SCARAMOUCHE
I've got shorter legs than you!
GALLILEO
Don't worry, your mouth makes up for
them.
SCARAMOUCHE
You didn't have any objections to it
last night.
GALLILEO
That is below the belt!
SCARAMOUCHE
Which seems to be all you think women
are good for!
GALLILEO
Hey we're not on some feminist
awareness course here babe, it's a
battle as big as the planet!
SCARAMOUCHE
As big as your ego more like!
GALLILEO
Me egotistical! Lets get one thing
straight here. You're a girl. You're
slower than me, weaker than me....
SCARAMOUCHE
Cleverer than you...
GALLILEO
What? Just because you managed to
reverse the polarity on a couple of
micro transcievers?
SCARAMOUCHE
Yes.
GALLILEO
My intelligence is abstract! I have
the mind of an artist.
SCARAMOUCHE
A piss artist!
GALLILEO
A rock artist! And I have a world to
save, so if you're going to hold me up
then....
SCARAMOUCHE
Hold you up! Listen mate. We're in
this together, and despite the fact
that you're emotionally immature,
scared of commitment AND you kept your
socks on...I'm staying!
GALLILEO
Suit yourself!
SCARAMOUCHE
Don't worry. I will!
Together they sing an edgy, spirited HAMMER TO FALL.
As the crashing opening instrumental ROCK of HAMMER TO FALL
blasts through They FIGHT VERY DRAMATICALY. They continue
to fight as Galileo sings, taunting Khashoggi.
GALLILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
Yeah! (Yeah!)
GALLILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
(cont'd)
What? (What?)
GALLILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
(cont'd)
Hey! (Hey!)
GALLILEO
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Wake the dead
Fight the fight
Oh Lady Mercy won't be home tonight
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
You don't waste no time at all
GALLILEO
Don't hear the bell but you answer the
call
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
It comes to you as to us all
SCARAMOUCHE
We're just waiting for the hammer to
fall. Hey!
GALLILEO
Hey!
SCARAMOUCHE
Yeah!
GALLILEO
Yeah! The hammer to fall
SCARAMOUCHE
Oh ev'ry night and ev'ry day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the western way
baby
Build your muscles as your body decays
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Toe your line and play their game
SCARAMOUCHE
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Til one day they call your name
GALLILEO
You'll know it's time for the hammer
to fall. Yeah!
SCARAMOUCHE
Rich or poor
Or famous for your truth
It's all the same
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Oh no, oh no
SCARAMOUCHE
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Oh no
SCARAMOUCHE
Baby, now your struggles all in vain
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
What the hell we fighting for?
GALLILEO
Just surrender and it won't hurt at
all
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
You've just got time to say your
prayers
GALLILEO
While you're waiting for the hammer
to..
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Hammer to fall
GALLILEO
Ay-oh
SCARAMOUCHE
Ay-oh
GALLILEO
The hammer to fall
SCARAMOUCHE
Ee-ah
GALLILEO
Ee-ah
SCARAMOUCHE
The hammer to fall
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
Hey! Yeah!
While you're waiting for the hammer to
hammer to fall.
Give it to me one more time
SCARAMOUCHE
(Spoken)
In your dreams mate!
SCENE TEN. THE SEVEN SEAS DRINKING CLUB.
We discover POP, who was interrogated in the first scene.
He is a barman, he polishes glasses and sings THESE ARE THE
DAYS OF OUR LIVES very mournfully.
POP
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect you know?
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shining we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Most of my life's been just a show
Now as the chorus kicks in the lights come up on the Seven
Seas Bar, full of haggard old hippies drowning their
sorrows.
POP AND THE PATRONS OF THE
BAR
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing remains
POP
When I look and I find no change
(ooh ooh ah)
You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life's just a game
No use in sitting and a thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through the kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow
POP AND THE PATRONS OF THE
BAR
Cos these are the days of our lives
(These are the days of our lives)
They're flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now
But one thing remains
POP
When I look and I find hope still survives
(ooh ooh ah)
Oh yeah!
The bar is surrounded by natural beauty, there are
mountains and through the great windows of the bar can be
seen a vast lake. We notice that Big Macca, Aretha and
Madonna etc. are sitting at a table but they are not like
before, they seem lost and empty. At the end of the song
Galileo and Scaramouche enter, they see their old friends
and are delighted.
GALILEO
Sir Paul McCartney! Meatloaf! Bob the
Builder! You guys are all here! It's
so good to see you!
SCARAMOUCHE
How did you escape?
GALILEO
This is fantastic. The Bohemians are
back! The fight is on!
But their old friends are now brain fried zombies.
BM
Do I know you, kid?
Pop interjects from behind the bar
POP
Your friends aren't there dude. Their
bodies are but their spirits are gone.
They've been processed man.
Galileo and Scaramouche go to the bar.
GALILEO
What do you mean?
POP
This is where they all come, the guys
and chicks who tried to break on
through to the other side and failed.
They come to drown themselves in The
Seven Seas of Rhye, Rye whiskey man,
the last comfort of those who have
rocked.
Pop puts a bottle of Jack on the counter.
SCARAMOUCHE
Why do they come here?
POP
You mean apart from in order to get
permanently pissed?
SCARAMOUCHE
Yes.
POP
There's something about this place,
It's like there's a spirit here. Long
ago, before global warming, the lake
was much smaller, who knows maybe
there's something beneath the water.
Something those washed out mothers
need to be close to.
SCARAMOUCHE
So who are you?
POP
I was a librarian, Astral Babe.
At the place where the secret history
is kept. I got a little too interested
in the stuff I was reading.
SCARAMOUCHE
They processed you?
POP
They tried but I guess I knew too
much, they couldn't zap it all. I may
be pretty screwed up but I'm still the
most together dude at the Seven Seas.
That's why I'm the barman.
SCARAMOUCHE
So you remember anything of what you
read? Of the secret histories?
POP
I only remember one story. A legend so
strong and powerful that they could
not wipe it from my brain. Would you
like to hear it?
SCARAMOUCHE
No, I thought we'd just have a quick
drink and bugger off!
POP
Ouch! Balls broken!
GALILEO
Well perhaps you could tell us
something of what you know. Mr Um...
POP
Pop, they call me Pop.
GALILEO
Well we would love to hear it. Oh wise
and mysterious dude called Pop.
POP
Well, it seems that a log time ago in
the first decade of the 21st century,
there were those who foresaw the
nightmare that was to come. This was
at the very beginning of music
homogenization, a time of boy bands
and girl bands...and boy and girl
bands...and girl bands with a couple
of boys that looked like girls...They
called themselves bands but they
weren't bands at all. They were just
pretty pretty dancers with multi-track
voices.
GALILEO
It's been that way ever since.
POP
Exactly. A three hundred year bum
vibe.
GALILEO
It all sounds so plausible, but how
can you be so sure.
POP
Because it was foretold. Take a look
at this.
Pop crosses behind the bar and produces a video tape.
GALLILEO
Wow! What is it?
POP
It's a 'VI-DEO'...a VI-DEO TARP'. An
ancient scroll of holy text.
BOHEMIANS
Ohhhhh......
POP
They all want it you know. They all
want the 'VI-DEO TARP', but i've got
it, it's Mine...it's my precious. I
stole it on the day I was captured and
through ten long years of hell in a
laser cell I've kept it
hidden...Secreted...out of
sight...wedged deep within the murky
cleft of my sweaty...
SCARAMOUCHE
That is too much information Pop! Just
tell us what it is.
POP
It's a message from the past! A
warning laid down for us in
antiquity...watch oh ye seekers after
truth...I will now place the `VI-DEO`
in the `TEELEEVYSEEOWN` listen to
precious and learn!
This is a BIG MOMENT. Pop inserts the tape and presses
play. We hear the famous opening moments from BO RAP.
QUEEN ON TAPE
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
That is all there is. Pop presses the stop button.
POP
That's all there is. The rest
unfortunately is an episode of
something called I'm a Celebrity Get
Me Out of Here.....What a bunch of
Twats!
GALLILEO
But those four beautiful girls we justCLIFF RICHARD
Just a bit pissed pop.
POP
Don't worry about Cliff Richard. He's
indestructible! Now, In order to
protect the future of Rock n' Roll,
Queen decided to bury their finest
instruments against a time when there
would be none!
GALILEO
You mean real instruments still exist?
Somewhere, waiting to be found!
POP
Yes. But for three hundred years they
have lain hidden. Queen wove deep and
terrible spells to protect the
precious weapons of freedom from abuse
by those not worthy of playing them.
SCARAMOUCHE
So what happened to Queen?
POP
The first of their number died young.
Too wild, too beautiful for this
world. The other three rocked on into
the new century, pausing only to
create a smash hit musical based on
their greatest hits. Eventually, all
three were captured by Globalsoft and
secretly killed.....It is said that
the hairiest of the gang, a man named
Br1-ann was granted a final wish
before execution, he asked to be
allowed to play just one last guitar
solo.....And so was able to delay his
death by three and a half days.
Suddenly we hear VAST SOUNDS..... It is the noise of WATER,
millions of gallons of rushing water... The whole of the
Seven Sea is shaking.
SCARAMOUCHE
What's going on!
POP
Don't freak out sweet lady, they're
just draining the lake, they steal our
water all the time now, it's almost
down to its original level...
Galileo has seen something....
GALILEO
Look.... Look! What is that, emerging
from the waters? A man!
SCARAMOUCHE
A statue
GALILEO
A hero made from bronze and rock.
Everyone turns to look, even the zombies know that
something extraordinary is happening.... as an instrumental
break from WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS plays, upstage, the screens
rise and now there is a dazzling view across the gorgeous
lake, in the middle, half submerged but slowly being
revealed, bathed in light, standing heroic and proud, it
is.....
THE FREDDIE STATUE!!
SCARAMOUCHE
Who is it, who does it represent?
POP
I know this man... I saw many images
in the Secret History.... He is one of
the freedom fighters of Queen!... the
first to die.... The greatest,
brightest star of his time!
Now the penny is dropping for Scaramouche.
SCARAMOUCHE
Star! Bright star! Gazzer, your dream!
The bright bright star that will show
the way. The star isn't a star in the
sky at all, but a rock star!!
Freaky.
GALILEO
But what? What is he showing us?
SCARAMOUCHE
The way! It must be, the way to the
place of living rock! Living rock
isn't granite at all, it's music!
GALILEO
But Queen buried the instruments
there. How can instruments be buried
in music?
POP
The place of living rock, man. Live
rock and roll music! He's looking
towards it dude! The star is facing
NORTH! Well North and a little bit
west actually. To the place he once
ruled! The place where people came
together to be together...
GALILEO
The place where the champions played?
POP
Yes, the place of Champions! The old
arena...I'm sure of it! The machines
may have destroyed the stands and the
towers, but they could never destroy
the vibe of what they once
called...Wembley Stadium!
SCARAMOUCHE
We have to move quickly, now that the
star has shown us the way, it can
guide the police there too, there's no
time to lose.
POP
I'll come with you, I can show you how
to get there.
GALILEO
But we need transport! We need wheels!
The opening bars of BICYCLE kicks in.
BOHEMIANS
Bicycle! Bicycle! Bicycle!
SCARAMOUCHE
Bugger that, we have to save rock n'
roll! We can't turn up on a bike!
POP
It's very eco.
SCARAMOUCHE
But not very cool.
POP
You're right Crazy Lady. We'll take my
Harley! Rock's transport of choice.
Not as fast, clean or efficient as a
Japanese bike but it sounds humungus!
Pop's Harley appears on the trap.
POP (cont'd)
You get on behind me Baby. Nice. It's
been years since I've felt the soft
warm thighs of a rebel chick wrapped
round my skinny white arse.
SCARAMOUCHE
Forget it, I'll go in front.
POP
Well all right but don't blame me if I
push the bone.
SCARAMOUCHE
I felt that.....Gazzer, get on behind
me. And don't get any fresh ideas.
GALILEO
It's time. Time to avenge the mighty
Queen.... Time to avenge them all.
SCARAMOUCHE
The word rhymes with banker!
POP
Get on your bikes and ride!!!
The three of them have mounted up and as the crashing riffs
of Headlong once more assault and delight the senses, the
bike roars into action.
GALILEO
Rock n' Roll!!
SCARAMOUCHE
Get down!!
POP
Find me a bat, I want to bite it's
head off!! No sleep till Hammersmith!
And they sing a chorus of Headlong......
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO AND
POP
And you're rush-in' (Headlong)
SCARAMOUCHE
Out of control.
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO AND
POP
You think your (so strong)
POP
But there ain't no stoppin'
SCARAMOUCHE AND GALILEO
And there's nothin' you can, nothin'
you can, nothin' you can, nothin' you
can, nothin' you can, nothin' you can,
nothin' you can do about it!
ALL
Headlong!
As they do this the set changes behind them and they
arrive at.....Wembley....They get off the bike, they are
alone. It is cold and bleak.....the wind blows, it is a
desolate waste land. Nothing but rubble and rubbish. It is
miserable. Galileo is very brought down.
POP
Excuse me while I park the bike!
Pop wvaes his hands to send the bike down the trap!
GALILEO
There's nothing here. Nothing at all.
POP
Bummer.
GALILEO
No instruments, not even any rock.
POP
Just rubble.
GALILEO
This place must have been destroyed
centuries ago. It's no place of
champions anymore if it ever was. I've
failed Scaramouche. I don't know where
the holy axe is hidden and I will
never play the lost riffs, my dreams
never come true.
SCARAMOUCHE
Don't blame yourself Gazzer, it isn't
you're fault.
GALILEO
Thanks Scaramouche.
SCARAMOUCHE
No, I mean it's not your fault you're
a spineless, gutless, whinging little
cry baby!
GALILEO
Excuse me?
SCARAMOUCHE
I know why you can't find the guitar
mate. You remember what Pop said?
"Queen wove deep and terrible spells
to protect the instruments from those
not worthy of playing them".
GALILEO
You mean me?
POP
Ouch!
SCARAMOUCHE
What do you think the Mighty Queen
died for? So that you can act like a
pathetic little coward! You wanted to
be a rock star? Huh! They wouldn't
even have you in a boy band!
POP
Ooh!
GALILEO
Hey Babe! I'm getting kind of tired of
the self righteous thing OK! We tried,
we failed. The instruments aren't
here.
SCARAMOUCHE
Then we'll have to make music without
them!
GALILEO
What a cappella?
POP
No!
SCARAMOUCHE
If necessary.
POP
It's never necessary!
SCARAMOUCHE
Isn't that what it was all about?...in
the beginning? Kids doing it for
themselves! Playing in the streets! In
the garages!
POP
Yes! Yes! It was!
SCARAMOUCHE
So come on Gazzer, where's the bloke I
used to love, where's the bloke with
the lead in his pencil? Where is
Shagileo Gigolo?
GALLILEO
Right here babe!
SCARAMOUCHE
Well prove it then, are we gonna rock
or what?
GALILEO
Yes! Yes we are! I don't need some old
second hand instruments to make music.
I can do it myself! The music of a
human being, not a machine.
SCARAMOUCHE
Right on!
POP
Hello Wembley!!
GALILEO
But.... Not without you Scaramouche.
You remember what Britney Spears said
before he died? Making music is about
love....you do it for your baby...and
I can only do it for you. I love you
Scaramouche with all my heart. Please
forgive me. Please come back to me
because if you don't I don't know if I
can do this thing and the kids will be
forever in chains.
SCARAMOUCHE
God! Talk about emotional blackmail.
Come here you silly banker!
She grabs him and they have a huge snog.
POP
Ooh, I've gone all tingly.
SCARAMOUCHE
So let's rock.
Galileo is trying, desperately seeking to summon up
inspiration from within he is truly ready but it is not
easy.... He is tense...Desperate, trying to summon up the
spirit...
GALILEO
I....don't know how to start.....
Scara is egging him on.
SCARAMOUCHE
Come on Buddy! You're a boy....
Pop also tries to encourage Galileo.
POP
Make a big noise!
SCARAMOUCHE
Playing in the street!
POP
Gonna be a big man some day.....
GALILEO
Hey! Hey that's it!!....
SCARAMOUCHE
What is?
Tentativly Galileo, echoes their words, but as a chant....
GALILEO
B...B...Buddy...Buddy your a
boy....make a big noise...
Playing in the street gonna be a big
man some day....
POP
What a curiously exhilarating
collection of words.
Now Galileo is really summoning it up. He pauses, then he
begins to stamp the ground to gather his strength and
continues.
GALILEO
You got mud on your face, You big
disgrace. Kicking your can all over
the place
Now something magical happens. In the distance the drum
beat begins.
GALILEO (cont'd)
Listen Scaramouche. It's the beat, the
beat is returning.
SCARAMOUCHE
The beating of our hearts!
GALILEO
Hearts of solid rock!
Galileo sings to the beat with growing confidence.
GALLILEO
Buddy you're a boy. Make a big
noise...Playing in the street gonna be
a big man some day...You got mud on
your face, you big disgrace. Kicking
your can all over the place
POP
Singing.GALILEO
We will we will rock you!
POP
Yeah!
GALLILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
We will we will rock you!
POP
Come on!
GALLILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
We will we will rock...
Now something fabulous happens! Something magical!
The famous guitar riff from WE WILL ROCK YOU rips through
the air and as it does so from a great pile of
rubble...From the ashes of Wembley Stadium there emerges a
guitar! Half embedded in the rock!
SCARAMOUCHE
What's happening?
POP
Thunderbolt and lightening, very,very
frightening.
GALILEO
Scaramouche! Look! An instrument! A
musical instrument!
SCARAMOUCHE
So they exist after all!
POP
The dream machine! The most powerful
weapon of freedom known to man! An
electric guitar! Seize it Shagileo
Gigolo, for none but the just shall
play the hairy one's mighty axe. None
but the kids!
SCARAMOUCHE
Wow! You're my guitar hero!
GALILEO
Yes I am Baby! And now! Let's rock!
He tries to play it but is complete crap
POP
Oh no man! The rebirth of modern jazz!
SCARAMOUCHE
I thought you were really good Gaz....
No really!
Scaramouche grabs the guitar and rips off a couple of huge
killer chords and a bit of diddling.
GALLILEO
The hairy God of Rock is back and this
time he's a girl.
SCARAMOUCHE
So I'll play, you sing.
GALLILEO
Yeah!
POP
And I'll be a groupie. Anyone want to
see my tits?.....(Actually my nipple
rings have gone a bit septic!)
SCARAMOUCHE
Shut up Pop!
POP
Received and understood, but first...
Pop whips out a little palm pilot.
GALLILEO
What are you doing Pop?
POP
What do you think? Hacking into the
Globalsoft mainframe and e mailing the
power of rock to every Ga Ga kid on
the planet. Soon they'll all be
Bohemians.
SCARAMOUCHE
But Pop, the Killer Queen will get
your email too!
Pop glances at his modem.
POP
Oh no, she just did.
The screen flickers and Killer Queen appears to big guitar
chords.
KILLER QUEEN
Who dares play live rock music on
Planet Mall?
THE BAND
We do Killer Queen! Alright?
KILLER QUEEN
Who?
THE BAND
Shagilleo Gigolo's Band!
GALILEO
Did you hear that Scaramouche? I've
got a band...now the kids can see the
true power of rock. Boys unleash the
Mighty Riffs and tie that mother down!
The band play a power riff as the Killer Queen screen flys
out!
KILLER QUEEN
No, no, no, no, no........!
The Killer Queen screen disappears.
GALLILEO
Yeah! Pop, bring me my mike.
POP
I'm a groupie and a roadie! I'll have
to have sex with myself! So, no
change there then!
SCARAMOUCHE
Shut up Pop!
Pop collects mike stand for Galileo.
POP
One two... One two...
GALLILEO
And now lets rock!
Bohemians appear, they are in a state of ecstatic grace.
They have been drawn by the music... It is almost like some
pagan religious gathering...Gazza smashes back into the
song.
GALILEO
Buddy you're a young man hard man
Shouting in the street gonna take on
the world some day
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
You got blood on your face you big
disgrace Waving your banner all over
the place
ALL
We will we will rock you
POP

POP

POP

We will we will rock you we will we
will ROCK YOOOOOU!
During the guitar solo the music changes to WE ARE THE
CHAMPIONS.
GALILEO
I've paid my dues time after time
I've done my sentence but committed no crime
And bad mistakes I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come though
REST OF COMPANY
And I need to go
ALL
On and on and on and on
We are the champions my friends
And we'll keep on fighting to the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
PRINCIPLES (AND ENSEMBLE)
No time for losers
(Ooh)
Cause we are the champions
(We are the champions)
Of the world
(We are the champions my friends)
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
(Ooh)
Cause we are the champions
(We are the champions)
GALLILEO
Of the world
(Aah)
World
(Aah)
World
(Aah)
At the end of the song the show seems to be over and the
audience applaud.... but no.... suddenly the lights go out
on all but Galileo and Scaramouche....
It as if they are alone on stage once more. Galileo begins
to sing.... BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. Scaramouche joins him.
GALILEO
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama Ooh didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on carry on
As if nothing really matters
SCARAMOUCHE
Too late my time has come
Send shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Got to leave you all behind to face the truth
GALILEO
Mama ooh I don't wanna die
(Ooh anyway the wind blows Ooh)
Sometimes I wish I'd never been born at all
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh)
I see a little silhouetto of a man
ENSEMBLE
Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning
GALILEO
Very very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo oh
ENSEMBLE
Galileo, Galileo, Galileo Figaro
Magnifico Oh oh oh oh
GALILEO
I'm just a poor boy
Nobody loves me
ENSEMBLE
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
GALILEO0
Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?
ENSEMBLE
Bismillah! No
We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go,
GALILEO
Let me go
Never never let me go
ENSEMBLE
let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go oh oh oh oh
No no no no no no no
GALILEO AND SCARAMOUCHE
Oh mama mia, mama mia
(Mama mia let me go)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me for me!
(Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me for me!)
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
KHASHOGGI
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
(Oh baby, can't do this to me baby)
KILLER QUEEN AND KHASHOGGI
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here
(Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here)
Ooh Ooh yeah ooh yeah
GALILEO
Nothing really matters
SCARAMOUCHE
Anyone can see
GALILEO
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows...
Together they sing the song up to "sometimes wish I'd never
been born at all"
Then with "I see a little silhouetto of a man" other
Bohemians begin to be picked out in light...
Aah
Through the whole "GALILEO GALILEO" bit, individual voices
and figures are picked out around the stage until With
"Bismillah!" The whole thing EXPLODES back into vast
choral light.
Then of course at the end it all returns to just Galileo
and Scaramouche alone in the darkness for the last bit
"Nothing really matters etc"
Then even they disappear into the dark. Only Galileo's
voice is left.
...... Anyway the wind blows.......
THE END.
The encores and bows are enlivened by the glorious pomp
rock of Queen's own arrangement of GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
